In JavaScript, there is no direct support for method overriding and overloading as seen in some other programming languages like Java or C++. However, JavaScript provides a flexible and dynamic environment that allows you to achieve similar effects.

### Method Overriding:

Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. In JavaScript, we don't have strict classes, but we can achieve a form of method overriding through prototype inheritance.

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`;
};

function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
  this.breed = breed;
}

// Inheriting from Animal
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Overriding sayHello method
Dog.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  return `Woof, I'm ${this.name}, the ${this.breed}.`;
};

const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
console.log(myDog.sayHello()); // Output: Woof, I'm Buddy, the Golden Retriever.
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, and it overrides the `sayHello` method inherited from `Animal`.

### Method Overloading:

Method overloading involves having multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists. JavaScript does not natively support method overloading in the traditional sense. However, you can achieve similar behavior by checking the number or type of arguments within a function.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  if (arguments.length === 2) {
    return a + b;
  } else if (arguments.length === 3) {
    return a + b + arguments[2];
  } else {
    console.error("Invalid number of arguments.");
  }
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(add(2, 3, 4)); // Output: 9
```

In this example, the `add` function checks the number of arguments and provides different behavior based on the number of parameters. This is a form of method overloading in a dynamic language like JavaScript.

While JavaScript lacks native support for traditional method overloading and overriding, it offers flexibility through prototype-based inheritance and dynamic typing, allowing developers to achieve similar outcomes in a different way.
